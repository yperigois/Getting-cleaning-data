# Getting-cleaning-data

##How the script is working:
  -loading "data.table" and "dplyr" packages
  
  -reading and loading raw data with fread fonction:
  
    -For test and training data set loading subject, y and x file
    
  -for X, Y and subject data set, adding test and training data
 
  	-k_xx: global (Test+traing) dataset for X variable (561 data for each line)
 
  	-k_yy: global dataset for Y variable (activity code 1 to 6)
 
  	-k_subject: global dataset for subject variable (Id of person doing the test: 1:30)
  
  Read and load the features file to list all the items that are recorded in the X fles
